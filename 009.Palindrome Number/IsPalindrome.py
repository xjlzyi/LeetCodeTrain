# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

# Example 1:
# Input: 121
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# Example 3:
# Input: 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
